This app most notably demonstrates a user role system giving your web application and native application feel all within the browser.The app itself features a basic CRUD principle where we can create, read, update, and destroy Tweeets.
Replies, retweets, likes, and quite a few other foundational features of the famous social media giant are not implemented.
